[**CLI Portfolio**](https://sayhan1610.github.io/cli_portfolio) is a sleek, terminal-themed personal portfolio designed to make a lasting impression while being incredibly developer-friendly. So yeah, it's not just another portfolio template‚Äîit's an experience, offering simplicity, customizability, and style in a way you've never seen before.

## ‚ú® Why Choose CLI Portfolio?

### 1. **A Unique Terminal Experience**

Remember the excitement of typing commands in a terminal for the first time? With CLI Portfolio, your visitors can relive that thrill! Featuring a typewriter-style interface, lime-green text on a black background, and fun ASCII art ~~(yes, I'm obsessed with ducks)~~, this portfolio turns browsing into an adventure.

### 2. **Effortless Customization**

Hate digging through code to update your content? No worries, matey! This project fetches all its contents from simple JSON files. This means you can:

- Add or edit pages like `about`, `skills`, `projects`, and more without touching the core code.
- Customize commands and page content as easily as editing text.
- Focus on your story while the code does the heavy lifting.

### 3. **Better Open Source Project**

Unlike most portfolios that come with rigid structures, CLI Portfolio is:

- **Highly Modular**: Every page and command is treated as a separate route. Want to add a new feature? Just add a JSON file and update the routes!
- **Lightweight and Responsive**: Works like a charm on desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Extensible**: Add new themes, commands, or functionality without breaking a sweat.

### 4. **Geek-Approved Design**

The aesthetics are perfect for developers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts who want to showcase their skills while standing out. It feels like hacking into something cool, except the only thing getting hacked is the visitor's attention.

## üîß Customization Tips

### Add a New Command

1. Create a new JSON file in the `pages/` folder (e.g., `achievements.json`).

```json
{
  "content": [
    "Achievements",
    "- Built a terminal-themed portfolio",
    "- Learned JavaScript async/await",
    "- Won a hackathon!"
  ]
}
```

2. Add the route to `script.js`:

```javascript
const routes = {
        ...
        achievements: 'achievements',
}
```

3. Done! Type `achievements` in your CLI Portfolio to see the new page.
